                        <p>
                            SolJuice (or &quot;We&quot;) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) any unauthorized access to or use of our platform; (b) any alteration or loss of your NFTs or other data; (c) any content or conduct of any third party on the platform; or (d) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.

                        <p>
                    Upon successful purchase of an NFT from SolJuice, the ownership of the NFT is transferred to the buyer&apos;s designated wallet. The buyer has full ownership and can use, sell, or trade the NFT as they see fit. Each NFT purchased from SolJuice is a unique digital asset on the Solana blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying digital asset completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Solana Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any NFT.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                    Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, SolJuice grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased NFT, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, for personal, non-commercial use, or as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your NFT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Commercial Use: Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, SolJuice grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased NFT for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the NFT.
